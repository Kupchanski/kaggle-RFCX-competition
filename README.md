Our team  won gold medal (4th place) on data science competition at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection 
The solution write up is at https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection/discussion/220342

I'd like to thank my teammates, Rainforest Connection and Kaggle for this interesting and tricky challenge!
